## Hangman Game in Python

This code attempts to create a virtual game of Hangman. This version contains only 5 different possible words which may be found in the list named 'word_list'. I have incorporated a validation mechanic for inputs that the players make to ensure that they enter single characters from the English alphabet.

# Defined functions

In file milestone_3.py, there are defined functions which relate to the 2 operators which have already been implemented. One of which is in regards to the checking the validity of the players input ("ask_for_input(guess)"), and the other determines whether the guessed input is within the randomly chosen word ("check_input()").
